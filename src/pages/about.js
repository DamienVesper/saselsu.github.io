                            <p>SASE LSU emerged in February 2019, initially comprising a modest group of 25 active members.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>However, the unforeseen impact of COVID-19 created a disconnect between the LSU community and its students. Alongside the challenges of virtual interactions and the concerning rise in AAPI violence nationwide, students within the LSU community felt increasingly isolated</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Nevertheless, SASE LSU preserved, dedicating its efforts into engaging faculty, organizing interactive events, and highlighting accomplishments of current students and faculties. These endeavors aimed to generate awareness and initiate discussions centered around empowerment and community.</p>

                            <p>As Fall 2021 approached, SASE LSU gained momentum by prioritizing the development of a tightly-knit community. With the gradual decline of restrictions, we successfully brought students together after a prolonged period of isolation.</p>

                            <p>We organized events such as boba and paint socials, volunteering events with organizations like Cat Haven and Habitat for Humanity, and giveback nights at local Asian businesses. These initiatives fostered a safe environment and bolstered our presence within the LSU and Baton Rouge community.</p>

                            <p>With persistent dedication throughout the semester, membership skyrocketed to a remarkable 133 active participants by the spring of 2022. We remained steadfast in our commitment to enhancing visibility and nurturing a sense of community. Our Lunar New Year meeting exemplified the celebration of intercultural exchange, acting as a testament to our growth.</p>

SASE LSU serves as a space where individuals can embrace intercultural exchange against all odds, forge their own community within LSU, and, above all, to love purple and live gold.</p>
